# 🌮 The Little Taco Shop

This is my **Little Taco Shop** project — a simple multi-page website built while learning **HTML**.  
The project helped me understand the structure of web pages and how to connect them together.

## 📖 Project Overview

The website includes:
- **Home page** (`index.html`)
- **Hours page** (`hours.html`)
- **Contact page** (`contact.html`)

Each page contains navigation links, a favicon, and properly structured HTML elements such as:
- `<nav>` for navigation menus  
- `<dl>` for listing store hours  
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for form design  
- `<form>` and `<textarea>` for user messages  

The **Contact** page also includes a simple form where visitors can send a message (non-functional for now).

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Structure a website using semantic HTML tags  
- Link multiple pages together  
- Add a favicon to the head section  
- Create and format forms using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`  
-
